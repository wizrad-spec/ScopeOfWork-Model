Damaged Security Screen Door
* Initially attended the property but found it locked, as Trent Accutt from "Right at Home" had forgotten to leave it unlocked as arranged
* Arranged with Trent to obtain the access code and re-attended the property at a later date
* Gained entry using the access code and assessed the damaged security screen door, identifying a missing section of aluminum screen in the bottom right-hand corner
* Measured and cut a replacement section of aluminum screen to match the missing piece
* Installed the new screen section using pop rivets to secure it in place
* Ensured the repair was sturdy and the screen door functioned properly
* Tested the screen door to ensure proper operation and security
* Cleaned up any debris or materials from the repair process
