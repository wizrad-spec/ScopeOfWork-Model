• Initially attended Waraburra State School to repair a leaking flexi hose in the male toilets
• Upon inspection, the school requested a scope change to replace all flexi hoses in both male and female toilets due to age and wear concerns
• Replaced all existing flexi hoses in both male and female toilets with new ones to prevent future leaks and flooding
• Ensured all connections were secure and tested to prevent further issues
• During the process, plumbers encountered an issue with the aging gate valve, which could not be fully turned off
• Advised the school to replace the gate valve with a new ball valve, recommending excavation and replacement due to the valve's age and condition
